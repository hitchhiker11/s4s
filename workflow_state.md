## Plan: Mobile Responsiveness Improvement - Grid to Slider Conversion

### Problem Statement
Currently, category and product card sections (e.g., new arrivals, brands, bestsellers) on the main page use a responsive grid layout. When the screen width decreases for mobile viewports, the grid dynamically adjusts the number of columns. This behavior is not optimal for mobile user experience, as it can lead to cramped layouts or excessive scrolling.

### Solution Approach
Replace the current responsive grid behavior for category and product sections on mobile devices. Implement horizontal, swipeable sliders (carousels) for these sections specifically on mobile viewports (e.g., below a certain breakpoint like 768px). Desktop viewports will retain the existing grid layout. This will improve usability and visual appeal on smaller screens.

### Implementation Steps

1.  **Analysis Phase**:
    *   Identify all components/sections on the main page that currently use responsive grids for displaying category or product cards.
    *   Determine the appropriate breakpoint (e.g., 768px) to switch between the desktop grid view and the mobile slider view.
    *   Select a suitable JavaScript library for implementing the sliders (e.g., Swiper.js, Slick Carousel) if not already in use.

2.  **Environment Setup** (If needed):
    *   Install the chosen slider library (e.g., `npm install swiper`).
    *   Import necessary components and styles from the library.

3.  **Component Modifications**:
    *   Create or modify a responsive wrapper component (or use a hook) that detects the current viewport width.
    *   Update the identified components (e.g., `CategoryGrid`, `ProductGrid`, or container components) to conditionally render either the existing grid layout or a new slider component based on the viewport width.
    *   Create dedicated slider components (e.g., `CategorySlider`, `ProductSlider`) to encapsulate the slider logic and configuration.

4.  **Slider Implementation**:
    *   Configure the slider components with appropriate options (e.g., slides per view, space between slides, navigation arrows, pagination dots, loop behavior).
    *   Ensure the sliders are swipeable on touch devices and navigable with clicks if arrows are present.
    *   Pass the category/product data to the slider components for rendering individual items (slides). Reuse existing `CategoryCard` / `ProductCard` components within the slides if possible.

5.  **Styling**:
    *   Apply necessary CSS styles to the slider containers, slides, and navigation elements to match the desired design.
    *   Ensure styles are scoped correctly and do not interfere with the desktop grid layout.
    *   Adjust card styling if necessary for optimal display within a slider context.

6.  **Testing**:
    *   Thoroughly test the implementation across various screen sizes, focusing on the breakpoint transition.
    *   Test on different browsers and mobile devices (or emulators).
    *   Verify touch/swipe interactions and navigation controls.
    *   Ensure accessibility standards are met.

7.  **Performance Optimization** (Optional but recommended):
    *   Implement lazy loading for slider images or slides if performance is impacted.
    *   Ensure the slider library and its implementation are efficient.

## Log
- Initial plan created for mobile slider implementation.
- Plan approved by user.
- Installed Swiper.js library (`npm install swiper --legacy-peer-deps`).
- Renamed `CategoryGrid` directory to `ItemGrid`.
- Updated import path in `ResponsiveCategorySection.js`.
- Created `CategorySlider` component (`frontend/src/components/CategorySlider/index.js`) using Swiper.
- Created `ProductSlider` component (`frontend/src/components/ProductSlider/index.js`) using Swiper.
- Updated `ResponsiveCategorySection.js` to use `CategorySlider` for mobile view.
- Updated `ResponsiveProductSection.js` to use `ProductSlider` for mobile view.
- Updated hover animations on cards to darken the corner border instead of shadow and scale.
- Fixed mobile card sizing to better match Figma designs.
- Adjusted proportions for mobile product and category cards.

## Next Steps
- **Testing:**
    - Run the development server and visually inspect the changes.
    - Thoroughly test the components across various screen sizes (desktop grid vs. mobile slider, breakpoint transition).
    - Test on different browsers and mobile device emulators.
    - Verify touch/swipe interactions (touch) and navigation arrows (click).
    - Ensure card content (`CategoryCard`, `ProductCard`) displays correctly within slides.
    - Check `onAddToCart` functionality in `ProductSlider`.
    - Verify "View All" links.
    - Ensure accessibility standards are considered.
- **Performance Optimization** (If necessary based on testing):
    - Investigate lazy loading options for Swiper if performance is impacted on mobile.
    - Optimize images used in cards.
- **Update Status:** Set Status to TESTING once verification is complete.
