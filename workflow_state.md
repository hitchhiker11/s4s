## Plan: Mobile Responsiveness Improvement - Grid to Slider Conversion

### Problem Statement
Currently, our category and product cards on the main page form a grid layout that dynamically adjusts the number of columns when screen size decreases (mobile view). This approach is not optimal for mobile user experience.

### Solution Approach
Replace the responsive grid layouts with horizontal swipeable sliders/carousels specifically for mobile viewports. Desktop views will maintain their current grid layout.

### Visual Reference
The implementation should follow the layout shown in the provided screenshot, featuring:
- Horizontal sliding carousel for products on mobile
- Category navigation at the top
- Product cards showing product image, brand/name, and price
- "ПРЕДЗАКАЗ" (pre-order) button for applicable products
- Horizontal slider navigation indicated with directional arrows
- Clear section headers with "Смотреть все" (View all) option

### Implementation Steps

1. **Analysis Phase** ✓
   - Identified components using responsive grid layouts: CategoryCard, ProductCard
   - Determined breakpoint for conversion: 768px
   - Selected Swiper.js as the slider library for implementation

2. **Environment Setup** ✓
   - Selected Swiper.js as our slider library
   - Added import statements for Swiper components and CSS

3. **Component Modifications** ✓
   - Created responsive wrapper components:
     - Created `ResponsiveContainer.js` - A higher-order component that detects viewport size
     - Created `CategorySlider.js` and `ProductSlider.js` for mobile views
     - Created `CategoryGrid.js` and `ProductGrid.js` for desktop views
     - Created `ResponsiveCategorySection.js` and `ResponsiveProductSection.js` as usage examples
   - Implemented for sections shown in screenshot:
     - Category navigation with sliders
     - Product listings with pre-order options
     - "Catalog" sections with view all links

4. **Implementation Details** ✓
   - CategorySlider Component:
     - Implemented horizontal slider with ~1.5 cards visible
     - Added navigation controls
     - Maintained CategoryCard component design
     - Added section header and "Смотреть все" link
   - ProductSlider Component:
     - Created horizontal swipeable cards
     - Implemented single product view with peek at next product
     - Added ПРЕДЗАКАЗ (pre-order) badges
     - Maintained brand/name hierarchy

5. **CSS Modifications** ✓
   - Created slider container styles
   - Modified existing card components for slider view
   - Added navigation elements (arrows, pagination dots)
   - Ensured proper spacing in slider mode

6. **Responsive Logic Implementation** ✓
   - Created viewport detection hook in ResponsiveContainer
   - Implemented conditional rendering logic
   - Set breakpoint at 768px

7. **Testing** (Pending)
   - Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes
   - Verify that slider navigation works with both touch and click
   - Ensure pre-order buttons are accessible in slider view
   - Test transition between desktop and mobile views

8. **Performance Optimization** (Pending)
   - Implement lazy loading for off-screen slides
   - Optimize images for slider view
   - Ensure smooth animations and transitions

## Log
- Initial plan created for mobile slider implementation
- Plan approved by client with screenshot reference provided
- Created ResponsiveContainer component with viewport detection logic
- Implemented CategorySlider and ProductSlider components for mobile views
- Created CategoryGrid and ProductGrid components for desktop views
- Created ResponsiveCategorySection and ResponsiveProductSection components as usage examples

## Next Steps
1. To complete implementation, install Swiper.js in the project:
   ```bash
   npm install swiper
   ```
2. Modify page components to use the new responsive section components
3. Test the implementation on different devices and screen sizes
4. Optimize performance based on testing results
