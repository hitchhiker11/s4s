# UI Component Library for Bitrix + React

This Storybook documents the UI components used in our Bitrix CMS React integration project.

## Project Architecture

Our frontend architecture is based on a React + Next.js application that integrates with an existing Bitrix CMS e-commerce site. The components are designed to work with server-side rendering for SEO compatibility while maintaining a modern React frontend.

## Component Structure

Our components follow the Atomic Design methodology:

### 1. Atoms
The basic building blocks of our interface:
- Buttons
- Icons
- Input fields
- Typography elements

### 2. Molecules
Groups of atoms that function together:
- Form fields
- Search bars
- Navigation links
- Cards

### 3. Organisms
Complex UI components composed of molecules and atoms:
- Headers
- Footer
- Product cards
- Category displays
- Brand features

### 4. Templates
Page-level component arrangements:
- Catalog templates
- Product detail templates
- Checkout flow templates

### 5. Pages
Complete page implementations:
- Home page
- Category page
- Product detail page
- Cart page

## Design Tokens

Our design system is built on a set of foundational tokens:

- **Colors**: Brand colors, UI states, and neutrals
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing values
- **Sizes**: Dimensions, border-radius, etc.
- **Animations**: Timing, easing functions
- **Shadows**: Elevation and depth
- **Breakpoints**: Responsive design breakpoints

## Integration with Bitrix

These components are designed to integrate with Bitrix CMS via AJAX/JSON, without modifying the backend logic. Server-side rendering is implemented via Next.js to maintain SEO compatibility.
